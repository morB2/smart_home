<h3>About The Project</h3>

The Smart Home System is an Arduino-based project. This system is designed to improve convenience, safety, and energy efficiency by automating various home functions.

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>RFID Entry System: Secure your home with an RFID-based door lock.</li>
<li>Rain Detection: Automatically close windows when rain is detected.</li>
<li>Gas Leak Detection: Alerts you with a buzzer if a gas leak is detected.</li>
<li>Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: Real-time display of temperature and humidity with automatic fan control when temperatures exceed 27Â°C.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface: Control the system via an HTML-based application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Built With</h3>
This project is built using the following components and technologies:

ESP32 - The core microcontroller used to manage sensors and automations, for Wi-Fi connectivity and controlling the smart home system via a web interface.<br/>
Various Sensors - Including RFID, rain, gas-MQ2, temperature and humidity sensor- DHT11.<br/>
HTML/CSS - For the user interface of the control application.
